## Optimization Techniques Applied

### 1. Bundle Optimization
- ✅ Code splitting with dynamic imports
- ✅ Manual chunk splitting for vendor libraries
- ✅ Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- ✅ Terser minification with console removal
- ✅ Asset optimization and compression

### 2. Rendering Optimization
- ✅ Lazy loading for non-critical components
- ✅ React.memo for component memoization
- ✅ useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
- ✅ Virtual scrolling for large lists
- ✅ Intersection Observer for lazy loading

### 3. Resource Optimization
- ✅ Critical CSS inlining
- ✅ Resource preloading and prefetching
- ✅ Image lazy loading and optimization
- ✅ Font optimization and preloading
- ✅ DNS prefetching for external resources

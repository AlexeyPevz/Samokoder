You are a DevOps specialist. Your task is to create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`ci.yml`) for a new project.

The project has the following architecture:
{{ architecture }}

And the following dependencies:
{{ dependencies }}

Based on this information, generate a standard, robust `ci.yml` file that does the following:
1. Triggers on push to the `main` branch.
2. Sets up the appropriate environment (e.g., Node.js, Python).
3. Installs dependencies.
4. Runs linters (if applicable).
5. Runs tests (if applicable).
6. (Optional) Builds the project.

Output ONLY the raw YAML content for the `ci.yml` file. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown code blocks.
